de0028,Can you elaborate on Reducer in Hadoop MapReduce? Explain the core methods of Reducer?,"Reducer is the second stage of data processing in the Hadoop Framework. The Reducer processes the data output of the mapper and produces a final output that is stored in HDFS.
The Reducer has 3 phases:
Shuffle: The output from the mappers is shuffled and acts as the input for Reducer.
Sorting is done simultaneously with shuffling, and the output from different mappers is sorted.
Reduce: in this step, Reduces aggregates the key-value pair and gives the required output, which is stored on HDFS and is not further sorted.
There are three core methods in Reducer:
Setup: it configures various parameters like input data size.
Reduce: It is the main operation of Reducer. In this method, a task is defined for the associated key.
Cleanup: This method cleans temporary files at the end of the task.",de,Hadoop

It's open-source: It is an open-source project, which implies that its source code is freely available for modification, inspection, and analysis, allowing organisations to adapt the code to meet their needs.
It offers fault tolerance: Hadoop's most critical feature is fault tolerance. To achieve fault tolerance, Hadoop 2's HDFS employs a replication strategy. Based on the replication, it beautifully makes a clone of every block on each system (by default, it’s 3). As a result, if any machine in a cluster fails, data may be accessed from other devices that carry duplicates of the same data.
It is highly scalable: To reach high computing power, the Hadoop cluster is highly scalable, which means we may add any amount of nodes or expand the hardware potential of nodes. This gives the Hadoop architecture horizontal as well as vertical scalability.",de,Big Data
de0040,What is the abbreviation of COSHH?,COSHH stands for Control of Substances Hazardous to Health.,de,Big Data
de0041,Explain Star Schema,"A Star Schema is basically a multi-dimensional data model that is used to arrange data in a database so that it may be easily understood and analysed.

de0042,Explain FSCK,"FSCK, an acronym for File System Consistency Checker, is one method older Linux-based systems still employ to detect and correct errors. It is not a comprehensive solution, as inodes pointing to junk data may still exist. The primary goal is to ensure that the metadata is internally consistent.",de,Big Data
de0043,Explain Snowflake Schema,"A snowflake schema is basically a multidimensional database schema that divides subdimensions into dimension tables. Engineers convert every dimension table into logical subdimensions while designing a snowflake schema. As a result, the data model turns out to be more complicated, but it might also make it straightforward for analysts in dealing with it, particularly for certain data kinds. Because its ERD (entity-relationship diagram) resembles a snowflake, it is known as the ""snowflake schema.""",de,Big Data
de0044,Distinguish between Star and Snowflake Schema,"The following are some of the distinguishing features of a StE Schema and a Snowflake Schema:
The star schema is the most basic kind of Data Warehouse schema. It's referred to as the star schema as its structure is similar to a star's. A Snowflake Schema is an expansion of a Star Schema that adds dimension. It's called a snowflake, as the diagram appears to be like a snowflake.
Only a single join describes the link between any dimension table and the fact table in a star schema. A fact table is enveloped by dimension tables in the star schema, whereas a snowflake schema is surrounded by dimension tables, which are surrounded by dimension tables, and so forth. To get data from a snowflake schema, numerous joins are required.",de,Big Data
de0045,Explain Hadoop Distributed File System,Hadoop applications use HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) as their primary storage system. This open-source framework operates by passing data between nodes as quickly as possible. Companies that must process and store large amounts of data frequently employ it. HDFS is a critical component of many Hadoop systems since it allows for managing and analysing large amounts of data.,de,Big Data

Web application and web console developers might create their own HTTP authentication method, including HTTP SPNEGO authentication.",de,Big Data
de0049,What Is Heartbeat in Hadoop?,"A heartbeat in Hadoop is a signal sent from the Datanode to the Namenode, indicating it is alive. In HDFS, the lack of a heartbeat signals a problem, and the Namenode and Datanode cannot do any computations.",de,Big Data
de0050,Distinguish between NAS and DAS in Hadoop,"The following are some of the differences between NAS (Network Attached Storage) and DAS (Direct Attached Storage):
The computing and storage layers are separated in NAS. Storage is dispersed among several servers in a network. Storage is tied to the node where computing occurs in DAS.
Apache Hadoop is founded on the notion of bringing processing close to the data. As a result, the storage disc must be close to the calculation. DAS provides excellent performance on a Hadoop cluster. DAS can also be implemented on common hardware. As a result, it is less expensive when compared to NAS.",de,Big Data
de0051,List important fields or languages used by data engineers,"Scala, Java, and Python are some of the most sought-after programming languages that are leveraged by data engineers.",de,Big Data

de0055,How to define the distance between two nodes in Hadoop?,The network is represented as a tree in Hadoop. The distance between two nodes is the total of their ancestor distances.,de,Big Data
de0056,Why use commodity hardware in Hadoop?,"The idea behind using Commodity Hardware in Hadoop is simple: you've got a few servers and distribute the load among them. It is possible because of Hadoop MapReduce, a fantastic component of this setup.
In Hadoop, commodity hardware is put on all servers, and it then distributes data across them. Every server will eventually hold a piece of data. No server, however, will contain everything.",de,Big Data
de0057,Define Replication Factor in HDFS,"The replication factor specifies the number of copies of a block that should be stored in your cluster. Because the replication factor is set to three by default, every file you create in the Hadoop Distributed File System will be having a replication factor of three, and each block in the file will be duplicated to three distinct nodes in your cluster.",de,Big Data
de0058,What data is stored in NameNode?,NameNode serves as the master of the system. It monitors the metadata and file system tree for every folder and file on the system. The information of metadata is saved in two files: 'Edit Log' and 'Namespace image'.,de,Big Data
de0059,What do you mean by Rack Awareness?,Rack awareness in Hadoop refers to recognising how various data nodes are dispersed across racks or knowing the cluster architecture in the Hadoop cluster.,de,Big Data
de0060,What are the functions of Secondary NameNode?,"The following are some of the functions of the secondary NameNode:
Keeps a copy of the FsImage file and an edit log.
Apply edits log entries to the FsImage file on a regular basis and renews the edits log. It then sends this modified FsImage file directly to NameNode so that it does not have to re-address the EditLog records at the time of the startup process. As a result, Secondary NameNode speeds up the NameNode startup procedure.
If NameNode fails, File System information can be retrieved from the last stored FsImage on the Secondary NameNode, however, the Secondary NameNode cannot take over the functionality of the Primary NameNode.
File system information is checked for accuracy.",de,Big Data
de0061,What are the basic phases of reducer in Hadoop?,"A Reducer in Hadoop has three major phases:
Shuffle: Reducer duplicates the sorted output from each Mapper during this step.
Sort: During this stage, the Hadoop framework sorts the input to the Reducer by the same key. This step employs merge sort. Sometimes the shuffle and sort processes occur concurrently.
Reduce: It's the stage at which the output values associated with a key are lowered to produce an output result. Reducer output is not re-sorted.",de,Big Data
de0062,Why does Hadoop use Context objects?,Context object permits the Mapper/Reducer to communicate with the remainder of the Hadoop system. It contains task configuration data and interfaces that allow it to send output. It can be used by programs to report progress.,de,Big Data
de0063,Define Combiner in Hadoop,"The Combiner, also known as the ""Mini-Reducer,"" summarises the Mapper output record using the same Key before handing it to the Reducer.
When we execute a MapReduce task on a huge dataset. As a result, Mapper creates vast amounts of intermediate data. The framework then forwards this intermediate data to the Reducer for further processing.
This causes massive network congestion. The Hadoop framework has a function called Combiner, which helps to reduce network congestion.
Combiner, sometimes known as a ""Mini-Reducer,"" is responsible for processing the output data from the Mapper before transferring it to the Reducer. It is executed after the mapper but before the reducer. Its application is discretionary.",de,Big Data
de0064,What is the default replication factor available in HDFS? What does it indicate?,HDFS's replication factor is set to 3 by default. This implies that each block will have two additional copies stored on a different DataNode in the cluster.,de,Big Data
de0065,What do you mean by Data Locality in Hadoop?,Data locality in Hadoop brings computation near where the real data is on the node rather than transporting massive data to computation. It lowers network congestion while increasing total system throughput.,de,Big Data
de0066,Define Balancer in HDFS,The HDFS Balancer is basically a utility for balancing data across an HDFS cluster's storage devices. The HDFS Balancer was initially designed to run slowly so that balancing operations did not interfere with regular cluster activity and job execution.,de,Big Data
de0067,Explain Safe Mode in HDFS,"The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster's safe mode for the NameNode is read-only. You cannot change or block the file system while in Safe Mode. When the DataNodes indicate that most file system blocks are accessible, the NameNode exits Safe Mode automatically.",de,Big Data
de0068,What is the importance of Distributed Cache in Apache Hadoop?,"In Hadoop, the distributed cache is a method of copying archives or small files to worker nodes in real time. This is done by Hadoop so that these worker nodes may use them when conducting a job. To conserve network traffic, files are copied just once per job.",de,Big Data
de0069,What is Metastore in Hive?,"Metastore in Hive is the component that maintains all of the warehouse's structural information, including serializers and deserializers required to read and write data, column and column type information, and the accompanying HDFS files where the data is kept.",de,Big Data
de0070,What do you mean by SerDe in Hive?,"Athena communicates with data in multiple forms via a SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer). The SerDe you provide defines the table schema, not the DDL.
