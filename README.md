# LLM project Interview Preparation Assistant

Pet project / 2nd Capstone project for DataTalks.Club LLM ZoomCamp`24: 

RAG application based on interview preparation questions for Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers.

Project can be tested and deployed in cloud virtual machine (AWS, Azure, GCP), **GitHub CodeSpaces** (the easiest option, and free), or even locally with/without GPU! Works with Ollama and ChatGPT.

For GitHub CodeSpace option you don't need to use anything extra at all - just your favorite web browser + GitHub account is totally enough.

## Problem statement

- [x] I made an Exam Preparation Assistant as the 1st LLM RAG app project
- [x] Then I successfully passed my Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer [exam](https://github.com/dmytrovoytko/DmytroVoytko/blob/master/achievements/GCP-PDE-cert.png)
- [ ] What's the next step? Right - Interview Preparation!

At some moment of life we want a new job, right? So I decided to make my 2nd LLM project that helps Data and ML Engineers prepare for a job interview.
Why? Because just technical knowledge even validated by professional certification(s) is not enough to get a job. Usually interview questions have a bit different angle than certification exams. In addition, interviews include soft skills assessment and behavioral questions.

With right prompts ChatGPT can be a decent interview assistant. Still, it can hallucinate as not trained well for specific topics yet. Or you want to use your local Ollama (like me), but open models know even less?

That's where RAG comes in! RAG is Retrieval Augmented Generation - the process of optimizing the output of a large language model (LLM). It references your prepared knowledge base before generating a response. So instead of asking LLM about interview topics "from scratch", RAG based assistant first gets context from your knowledge base (like QnA records) and then provides you better focused answers. This is what I use in this project.

Just imagine, you can 'talk to your data', amazing!‚ú®

## üéØ Goals

This is my 2nd LLM project started during [LLM ZoomCamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp)'24.

LLM Interview Assistant should assist users with their preparation to data/ML job interviews. It should provide a chatbot-like interface to easily find interview related information without looking through guides or websites.

As in the 1st project, I'm making it universal enough, so knowledge base can be extended to other professions, of course with some adjustments in RAG prompts.

Thanks to LLM ZoomCamp for the reason to keep learning new cool tools! 

## Dataset

I collected and processed questions with answers from sources like articles on respected Data professions related websites, and transform them into a [dataset](/data). Now it includes 2 .csv files - with Data Engineering and Machine Learning topics. And I plan to load some more QnAs universal for Data related positions. I prepared app UI and backend extensible.

**Structure**: id, question, text (=answer), position, section.

Sections used in search and help to focus on specific topics of the interview.

## :toolbox: Tech stack

* Frontend: 
    - UI: Streamlit web application for conversational interface
    - Monitoring: Grafana
* Backend:
    - Python 3.11/3.12
    - Docker and docker-compose for containerization
    - Elastic search to index interview questions-answers bank
    - OpenAI-compatible API, that supports working with Ollama locally, even without GPU
        * Ollama tested with Microsoft Phi 3/3.5 and Alibaba qwen2.5:3b models, they performed better than Google Flan-T5, Gemma 2
        * you can pull and test any model from [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library)
        * with your own OPENAI_API_KEY you can choose gpt-3.5/gpt-4o
    - PostgreSQL to store asked questions, answers, evaluation (relevance) and user feedback

## üöÄ Instructions to reproduce

- [Setup environment](#hammer_and_wrench-setup-environment)
- [Start the app](#arrow_forward-start-the-app)
- [Interact with the app](#speech_balloon-interact-with-the-app)
- [Monitoring](#bar_chart-monitoring)
- [Best practices](#best-practices)

### :hammer_and_wrench: Setup environment

1. **Fork this repo on GitHub**. Or use `git clone https://github.com/dmytrovoytko/llm-interview-assistant.git` command to clone it locally, then `cd llm-interview-assistant`.
2. Create GitHub CodeSpace from the repo ‚ÄºÔ∏è **use 4-core - 16GB RAM machine type**.
3. **Start CodeSpace**
4. The app works in docker containers, you don't need to install packages locally to test it.
5. **Go to the app directory** `cd interview_assistant`
6. If you want to develop the project locally, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (project tested on python 3.11/3.12).
6. **If you want to use gpt-3.5/gpt-4 API you need to correct OPENAI_API_KEY in `.env` file**, which contains all configuration settings. 
7. By default instructions (below) scripts will load Ollama/phi3.5 model. If you want to use also Ollama/phi3 or Ollama/qwen2.5:3b uncomment a line in `ollama_pull.sh`. Similarly you can load other Ollama models.

### :arrow_forward: Start the app

1. **Run `bash deploy.sh` to start all containers**, including elasticsearch, ollama, postgres, streamlit, grafana. It takes at least couple of minutes to download/build corresponding images, then get all services ready to serve. So you can make yourself some tea/coffee meanwhile. When the new log messages stop appering, press enter to return to a command line. 
![docker-compose up](/screenshots/docker-compose-00.png)

![docker-compose up](/screenshots/docker-compose-01.png)

2. Run `bash init_db_es.sh` 
* to create PostgreSQL tables:
* to ingest and index question database:

![init_db_es](/screenshots/init_db_es.png)


3. Run `bash ollama_pull.sh` to pull phi3/phi3.5 Ollama models

![Ollama pull](/screenshots/ollama_pulled.png)

If you want to use other models, you can modify this script accordingly, then update `app.py` to add your model names.

5. Finally, open streamlit app: switch to ports tab and click on link with port 8501 (üåê icon).

![Ports streamlit open](/screenshots/streamlit-open.png)

### :speech_balloon: Interact with the app

1. Set query parameters - choose position, model, query parameters (search type, response length), enter your question.
2. Press 'Find the answer' button, wait for the response. For Ollama Phi3/qwen2.5 in CodeSpace response time was around a minute.
![streamlit Find the answer](/screenshots/streamlit-00.png)

3. Check relevance evaluated by LLM.
![streamlit check](/screenshots/streamlit-02.png)

4. Give your feedback by pressing corresponding number of stars üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
- 1-2 are negative
- 4-5 are positive

5. App starts in wide mode by default. You can switch it off in streamlit settings (upper right corner).

### :bar_chart: Monitoring

You can monitor app performance in Grafana dashboard

1. Run `bash init_gr.sh` to create dashboard.
![Grafana init_gr](/screenshots/init_gr.png)

2. As with streamlit switch to ports tab and click on link with port 3000 (üåê icon). After loading Grafana use default credentials:
- Login: "admin"
- Password: "admin"


3. Click 'Dashboards' in the left pane and choose 'Interview preparation assistant'.

4. Check out app performance

### :stop_sign: Stop all containers

Run `docker compose down` in command line to stop all services.
Don't forget to remove downloaded images if you experimented with project locally! Use `docker images` to list all images and `docker image rm ...` to remove those you don't need anymore.

### Best practices
 * [x] Hybrid search: combining both text and vector search (Elastic search, encoding)


## Next steps

I plan to add more questions to knowledge database and test more models (Llama 3.2).

Stay tuned!
